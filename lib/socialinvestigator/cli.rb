    `hello NAME` will print out a message to the person of your choosing.

    Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "Hello, World!" program 
    as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language 
    developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being 
    developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of 
    Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.
