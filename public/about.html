# Mi casa es su casa

Come on down for some food, drink, and to hear what's up.  Twice a month we are going to meet and have a few people present 5-10 minutes on a subject, open up the floor and go deep.

Everything around the business of software is on the table.  From product pitches, to talks about methodology, or coding trips, we want designers, engineers and enterpreures to share what they know.

    "You HAVE to present"
  end
